# Computer-Vision

This repoository contains the implementations for computer vision projects like camera calibration, face tacking and object classification in real-time that use OpenCV library for rendering and Tensorflow 2 models for classification of objects. 

The pretrained model: ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_2017_11_17 is used to classify and label objects in real time.
